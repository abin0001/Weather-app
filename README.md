## Weather App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This is a weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to view current weather conditions in a user-friendly interface.

**Features:**

- Displays current weather information (temperature, feels like, weather description, etc.)

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abin0001/Weather-app.git
   ```

2. **Open the Files:**

   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to launch the app.

**How it Works**

1. Enter a city name in the search bar.
2. Click the search button.
3. The app will fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (you'll need an API key).
4. If the city name is valid, the app will display the current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.
5. If the city name is invalid, an error message will be displayed.

**Customization**

- You can customize the appearance of the app by modifying the CSS file (`style.css`).
- To use a different weather API, you'll need to update the JavaScript code (`scripts.js`) to interact with the new API's endpoint and data format.
